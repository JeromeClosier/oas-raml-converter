If a location specifies a region, rather than a point, the database may return an UNIMPLEMENTED error if it does not support query by region.

          There is no upper limit on the number of locations included in a available spectrum batch request, but the database may restrict the number of locations it supports by returning a response with fewer locations than specified in the batch request. Note that geolocations must be those of the master device (a device with geolocation capability that makes an available spectrum batch request), whether the master device is making the request on its own behalf or on behalf of a slave device (one without geolocation capability).

For example, It may be used to request generic slave device parameters without having to specify the device descriptor for a specific device. When the requestType parameter is missing, the request is for a specific device (master or slave), and the device descriptor parameter for the device on whose behalf the batch request is made is required.'
