                  If the diff was too large and timed out.

                  Since this endpoint does not employ any form of pagination, but
                  instead returns the diff as a single document, it can run into
                  trouble on very large diffs. If Bitbucket times out in cases
                  like these, a 555 status code is returned.

                The request URL you POST to becomes the destination repository URL. For this reason, you must specify an explicit source repository in the request object if you want to pull from a different repository (fork).

                Since not all elements are required or even mutable, you only need to include the elements you want to initialize, such as the source branch and the title.

                  Since this endpoint does not employ any form of pagination, but
                  instead returns the diff as a single document, it can run into
                  trouble on very large diffs. If Bitbucket times out in cases
